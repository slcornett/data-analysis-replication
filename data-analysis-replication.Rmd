#### **background**\
The southern Darwin's frog (*Rhinoderma darwinii*) mouth-brooding frog species endemic to Chilean Patagonia. *R. darwinii* has a fascinating method for reproduction: the female (egg-producer) deposits eggs and  the male (sperm-producer) fertilizes them, then guards them until the embryos are visibly wriggling inside. Then the male transfers those eggs to their vocal sac where they will be safe from predators and receive nutrients from the male (similar to marsupial embryonic development in their pouch). Ultimately, the male broods these fertilized eggs, often from multiple clutches with different partners, in their vocal sacs for about 50 days, until fully developed froglets emerge by pushing their way out the male’s mouth! All a while during this gestation period, the male continues to call for mates (Sandmeier, 2016)! There are 3 sex roles in this species: pregnant male (MP), non-pregnant male (M or NPM), and female (H or F), and the main sexually dimorphic characteristic is size, where the egg-producers (F) are slightly larger. In this nearly sexually monomorphic (i.e., the sexes look physically identical) species, mate selection depends on advertising calls, and *R. darwinii* is one of the few species where all sexes (PM, NPM, and F) use advertising calls to attract the attention of a potential mate (Serrano et al., 2020).\

#### **hypothesis**\
To investigate the factors modulating monomorphic vs. dimorphic sexual signals in the *R. darwinii*, Serrano et al. (2020) hypothesized species with temporally variable periods of intrasexual competition will have monomorphic instead of dimorphic sexual signals to ensure conspecific recognition. In *R. darwinii*, they specifically focus on timing/availability of advertising calls for mate attraction used by calling (pregnant and non-pregnant) males and calling females (i.e., vocal phenology) (Serrano et al., 2020).

#### **methods**\
They investigated this with a population of southern *R. darwinii* on Chiolé Island in Southern Chile during mating season (October 2015-February 2016). Of the 156 frogs caught in the field (118 adults), they recorded calls from 32 of them (**Plot1**) In the field, they first recorded individual calls (tracks) then collected population monitoring data (snout-vent length, SVL (mm); weight (g)). They also collected data on the sex and sexual status (MP = pregnant male, H = female, M = non-pregnant male) of each frog caught using body size and morphological characteristics. For the pregnant males, they counted externally the number of larvae in the vocal sacs. For each call recordings, they measured the call repetition rate (CRR, number of calls made in a 5 min period after the first call produced), the sound pressure level (SPL, dB), call duration (CD, seconds), the number of notes per call (NC), the note duration (ND, ms), the dominant frequency of the call (DF, Hz); and the amplitude of each vocalization (root mean square (RMS) amplitude) (Serrano et al., 2020).\
The Serrano et al. (2020) used *Simple Pearson correlations* to explore the association used to explore association between **acoustic variables of the calls (CRR, SPL, CD, NC, ND, DF)** with **physical characteristic variables (SVL, weight)** (data not shown in article). They used *Spearman correlations* to determine the association between **acoustic properties of the calls of pregnant males** and the **number of tadpoles in their vocal sacs** (data not shown in article). The authors used an *ANOVA* to investigate the differences in acoustic variables depended on the relative body size of the sexes (Table 1), then they conducted a discriminant function analysis (DFA) for the note duration, dominant frequency, sound pressure level, and aggregated entropy of 4-notes calls (the most common call structure), then analyzed using two linear discriminant vectors (LD) (Figure 4) (Serrano et al., 2020). 

#### **results**\
Ultimately, Serrano et al. (2020) found females, who have larger body size (SVL and weight) than both male sexes, had longer note duration and call duration than any males (Table 1, Figure 3), and, even when data was corrected for SVL, no acoustic variable had a significant difference between the sexes, based on their ANOVA (Table 1), suggesting body size explains any variation among the acoustic variables and a monomorphic call structure. They also found a negative relationship between number of tadpoles in the vocal sacs of pregnant males and their call amplitude, indicating the advertising call of pregnant males is attenuated by an increased number of tadpoles AND could be an auditory indicator of tadpoles thus could be used for selecting a mate (data not shown;  just very cool! This is something several other students and I studied with the first author of this paper in the field in 2019)! Ultimately, they propose mutual selective pressures of the different sexes might contribute to social recognition and sexual status recognition (i.e., recognition of reporoductive state, active or not) of individuals (Serrano et al., 2020).

### **data replication**\
I will be replicating the descriptive statistic analysis of the qqPlots, Simple Pearson Correlation, Simple Spearman correlation to explore normality trends in the data, just as the authors did, and ANOVA presented in Table 1 of Serrano et al. (2020). THen I will be replicating the Inferential statistical analysis of acoustic variables note duration, call duration, and  dominant frequency (figure 3). Lastly, I will replicate the linear discrimination analysis of 5 acoustic variables (Dominant Frequency, Call Rate, Note Duration, Aggregated entropy, and Sound Pressure Level) (figure 4).

## Statistical Replications/Reanalysis
>Be sure to **thoroughly** explain what replications you are doing and comment your code so that it is easy for a reader to understand.  
Include in this section relevant tables/figures/values from the original paper for comparison to what you accomplished with your replication.  
Note that I want you to do the bulk of any *exposition* using text and markdown syntax outside of code blocks. That is, your document should not just be one big code block with ***R*** style comments but rather a nicely formatted report with code separated from exposition, interpretation, and discussion.]\

```{r selecting variables and organizing data by sex}

df<- d %>% dplyr::select(Nombre, Sex, Larvas, LHC, Peso, Calls5min, CRR, NC, ND, CD, DF, SPL, `RMS Amp`, `Agg Entropy`, `Avg Entropy`)
# renaming Sex variables in dataframe so will print nicer in the Tukey post-hoc. yes I could just use Sexo but I don't have to change all the code below if i do it like this. I didn't realize the labels were going to be a problem until after I wrote all the code for replication. Also now my visualization labels will match those used in the paper.  
df <- df %>%
    mutate(Sex = case_when(Sex == "Females" ~ "F",

The authors reported performing the following statistical analyses before performing their ANOVA. As mentioned before, they used **Simple Pearson Correlations** to determine if the different acoustic variables correlate with either **Snout-Vent Length (LHC, mm)** or **mass (g)** (Serrano et al., 2020). They also performed **Spearman Correlations** to determine an association between acoustic variables and the number of tadpoles in the vocal sacs of pregnant males (Serrano et al., 2020). Below, I repeat these tests.

Serrano et al. (2020) first verified the normality criteria for all the variables in their data using quantile-quantile plots, likely to determine if any of their variables needed to be transformed before analyzing them with ANOVAs. Though they do not show these plots in their paper, I am replicating them below because the authors do not report which variables were transformed nor do they report how they were transformed, other than stating they used the Box Cox transformation.
```{r qq plots, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

Based on these plots, the two variables that appear to not fit the normality criteria for ANOVA are the two acoustic variables of entropy (**Average Entropy** and **Aggregated Entropy**). As the authors describe in their Statistical methods, I will transform these data useing a `boxcox()` from the {MASS} package to determine how to best transform these variables for ANOVA.

#### Box-Cox transformations for non-normal variables in ANOVA
Here, I run Box-Cox transformation for linear models/ANOVAS to determine how to transform variables not fitting normality criterion based on qqplot. The `boxcox()` function computes and plots the log-likelihood for an `object` to show the exponent power ($\lambda$) the response variable in the `object` should be raised to transform the `object` to fit normality criteria for comparison in ANOVA.\
  • The `object` argument is the response variables (**Avg Entropy** and **Agg Entropy**) against the predictor variables (**Sex** or **Sex**+**Snout-Vent Length (LHC)**) that will be compared in an ANOVA (or in a linear model, but not doing that here).
  • The `lambda` argument is the vector values to check as potential exponential powers to raise the variable to in a transformation. By default, the function uses (-2, 2) with 0.1 interval steps. Functionally, this is the x variable in the plot output.\
  • `plotit = ` is a logical argument, and when it is set to `TRUE`, it will output a plot of   the 95% confidence log-likelihood curve. Setting it to `FALSE` prints all the the x vakues and y values separately.\
  • `interp` = 
instead of fitting a single, high-degree polynomial to all of the values at once.
spline interpolation fits low-degree polynomials to small subsets of the values
```{r boxcox transformation of non-normal variables for ANOVA}
require(MASS) # reported used for normalizing data for ANOVA
# boxcox of agg entropy vs sex.
boxcox(df$`Agg Entropy` ~ df$Sex, lambda = seq(-2, 2, 1/10), plotit = TRUE, # "object" 
       interp = TRUE, eps = 1/50, xlab = expression(lambda), #interp TRUE gives slightly lower lambda (like 0.9 vs 0.8 with FALSE)
       ylab = "log-Likelihood")
# transformation for Aggregated Entropy Vs Sex
df <- df %>% mutate(AggE_t1 = (`Agg Entropy`)^(-9/10)) # adding column of transformed AggEntropy

# boxcox of agg entropy vs Sex corrected for snout-vent length
#boxcox(df$`Agg Entropy` ~ df$Sex + df$LHC, lambda = seq(-2, 2, 1/10), plotit = TRUE, # object
#       interp = TRUE, eps = 1/50, xlab = expression(lambda), #"interp"
#       ylab = "log-Likelihood")
# transformation for Aggregated Entropy Vs Sex + SVL
#df <- df %>% mutate(AggE_t2 = (`Agg Entropy`)^(-7/10)) # adding column of transformed AggEntropy

# boxcox of Avg entropy vs Sex
boxcox(df$`Avg Entropy` ~ df$Sex, lambda = seq(-2, 2, 1/10), plotit = TRUE, # "object"

       ylab = "log-Likelihood")

df <- df %>% mutate(AvgE_t1 = (`Agg Entropy`)^(-1/10)) # adding column of transformed AvgEntropy
```


#### Acoustic Variables (response variable) vs Sex (predictor variable)\
In the methods, the authors reported using {car} package for Anova function (though they do not report the type). Below, for each acoustic variable included in Table 1, I fist make an ANOVA model (using the `aov()` function) of the acoustic variable to see if it varies between the three sexes (female (F), pregnant male (MP), non-pregnant male (NMP): `aov(data = df, [acoustic variable] ~ Sex)` I then print the summary of the original ANOVA model to compar the F statistic and level of significance to that reported in table 1. 
```{r ANOVA to generate F value for comparison of different sexes}
#sex as predictor, NOT correcting by SVL = Sex+SVL as this gives a different F-value than what the authors report in table 1.
# Snout-Vent Length (mm) between different Sexes.
SVL_sex <- aov(data = df, LHC ~ Sex) # SVL = LHC
summary.aov(SVL_sex) # print the model summary 
# pulling out the F-statistic (nonparametric)
SVL_sex.F <- SVL_sex %>% # pull out the F-value
  generics::tidy() %>% # a nice table
  filter(term == "Sex") # since comparing between sexes
SVL_sex.F$statistic # prints the omnibus F-statistic of the between Sex comparison of SVL alone (full table will also show the p-value). matches the F-value and significance level reported in Table 1.

# Mass (g) between different Sexes.
mass_sex <- aov(data = df, Peso ~ Sex) # Peso = Mass/weight
summary.aov(mass_sex) # print the model summary 
# pulling out the F-statistic (nonparametric)
mass_sex.F <- mass_sex %>% # pull out the F-value
